# Connected-component-labelling-through-MATLAB
This is a MATLAB project that utilises the image processing toolbox to convert any image to its edge image using Canny algorithm and then label connected components in it. The whole labelling algorithm is in a function that you can apply to any image. The edge image goes through the labelling algorithm and final image is displayed. This project is a good aid at understanding the connected-component labelling algorithm using MATLAB's matrix and image operations.The comments explain every line in the code. You are encouraged to optimise the code and make it shorter, i'm not much of a pro :)
